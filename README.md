# Ofaveolata_Durusdinium-Annotated-Transcriptome
Includes the transcriptome annotation files needed for RNA-Seq analysis of the coral Orbicella faveolata and algal symbionts of the genus Durusdinium. Transcriptomes generated by Young et al. (in review) and Shoguchi et al. (2021) (https://marinegenomics.oist.jp/symbd/download/102_symbd_transcriptome_nucl.fa.gz).

Annotation Files created by Michael Studivan (studivanms@gmail.com) using the pipelines developed by Misha Matz (https://github.com/z0on/annotatingTranscriptomes and https://github.com/z0on/emapper_to_GOMWU_KOGMWU)
